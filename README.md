# Space Sim

Welcome to this Space Simulator. The goal is with this project was to somewhat
accurately simulate N-Body problems based on real world physics. The celestial
bodies masses and the distances involved are all calculated using gravitational
equations. The simulation is not an exact representation but more of a learning
tool to show how massive objects can interact and create chaotic systems.
