# Space Sim

Welcome to this Space Simulator. The goal is with this project was to somewhat
accurately simulate N-Body problems based on real world physics. The celestial
bodies masses and the distances involved are all calculated using gravitational
equations. The simulation is not an exact representation but more of a learning
tool to show how massive objects can interact and create chaotic systems.

## Features

- User can customize a body's position, color, mass, and initial vector.
- User can remove bodies from an existing system.
- User can load in example systems.
- User can play or pause simulation
- User can toggle viewing the vectors and orbital trails of bodies.
